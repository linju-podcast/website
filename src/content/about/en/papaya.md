Hey there! I'm a fresh-faced front-end developer hailing from Shanghai, and I'm on a mission to level up from the newbie zone.

Before I took the plunge into the exciting world of coding, I had a few other adventures. I dabbled in the art of teaching English at a famous chef school (yes, I know, cliché alert!), and I also managed the retail scene at a not-so-famous sportswear brand.

You know, I've always had this knack for languages (and guess what? Programming is a language too!). So, before I became a code wizard, I had some fun moonlighting as a subtitler, translator, and interpreter.

I must admit, I'm not the exam superstar, but I do have a pretty sweet spot for all things English. I breezed through the College English Test Level 6 (CET-6) back in high school, aced the IELTS listening and reading sections, and even tackled the challenging CATTI Level 2 in translation and interpretation. Oh, and I've been the perennial runner-up in countless English speech competitions, both at school and province levels!

When it comes to sports, I'm what you'd call an adventurous rookie. I am willing to try every sport under the sun. Lately, I've been loving every bit of bouldering. But the sport I've stuck with the longest, and poured my heart into, is good old-fashioned running.

Oh, and just so you know, I've probably seen 'Friends' more times than anyone should admit, and I'm a total nerd for exploring the magical spells of 'Harry Potter.' Alohomora! Let the adventure in the world of coding begin!
