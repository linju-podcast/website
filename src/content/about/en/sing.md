I used to be the quality control ninja in Tim Cook's hometown, but now I am writing code in the Silicon Valley! Why the sudden switcheroo, you ask? Well, it's all because I have a deep, burning love for lifelong learning.

Back in my school days, I was the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. I tinkered with pianos in elementary school, sprinted like a gazelle in middle school, and even formed a band in college. After sampling all the flavors of life in my student years, I decided to take on the thrilling world of billiards league/tournaments.

I've also dabbled in some open-source wizardry, did a bit of live streaming (nope, not the kind where you sell products), posted videos, and collaborated with friends to drop the knowledge bomb known as the _TypeScript Deep Dive_.

Oh, and let's not forget my secret passion â€“ I'm head over heels for catchy metal tunes, and you might catch me rocking out at a live band gig every now and then ðŸ¤˜
