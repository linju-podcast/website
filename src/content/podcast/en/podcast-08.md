## Show Introduction

S1ngS1ng is actually not your typical Bay Area programmer. While he did pursue a master's degree and stay in the United States, his graduate studies were in materials engineering. However, this doesn't deter him from living the life of commuting on I-880 during the daily rush hours.

Papaya's original life and the world of coding were worlds apart. Nonetheless, she relies on her strong English skills to bravely venture into the world of coding. Despite being a total beginner, she is now happily navigating the world of frontend development in the newcomer village.

The hosts will share their hands-on transcoding experiences from the perspectives of both veterans and newcomers. In this special episode outside of our regular series, we will share our best practices based on our own experiences.
