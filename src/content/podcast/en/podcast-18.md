## Show Introduction

Unlike our usual themes, this is a special episode featuring an interview with a unique personality, focusing on climbing.

We all know the saying, "We do not see the true face of Mount Lu because we are in it." I deeply understood this for the first time while climbing. Whenever I felt I couldn't reach the next hold and decided to jump down, I would watch the video my friends took of me climbing and realize that the distance was actually manageable.

This perspective shift is very subtle.

Interviews are like another side of this perspective shift. We are drawn to the effortless charm of the interviewee and want to understand them. But through close interviews, we learn about their thoughts, hesitations, and doubts from their words, tone, and pauses.

This episode features an interview with KK, who calls himself the "Banana Drifter" and is a sponsored athlete of Shilin Lizard. In this episode, he shares his thoughts on climbing, the lifestyle of a climbing nomad, and tips for beginners.
