## Episode Introduction

S1ngS1ng's father, Mr. Liu, decided to settle down in the U.S. after retirement, aiming to enjoy a pastoral life of gardening and flower-growing. However, a major issue arose—language. After all, Mr. Liu's English skills were almost non-existent.

How does a nearly 60-year-old learner, with a vocabulary of just around 300 words, navigate life in the U.S.? In this and the next episode, we’ll explore Mr. Liu's experience living in the U.S.

In this first episode, we’ll discuss the preparations Mr. Liu made before heading to the U.S. What methods did he use? How effective were they?

As the saying goes, the best time to plant a tree was ten years ago; the second-best time is now. Hopefully, this story of a nearly 60-year-old language learner will help you overcome the fear of learning a new language and ignite your curiosity to try new things!
