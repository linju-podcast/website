## Program Introduction

S1ngS1ng is actually not your typical Bay Area programmer. While he did pursue a master's degree and stay in the United States, his graduate studies were in materials engineering. However, this doesn't deter him from living the life of commuting on I-880 during the daily rush hours.

Papaya's original life and the world of coding were worlds apart. Nonetheless, she relies on her strong English skills to bravely venture into the world of coding. Despite being a total beginner, she is now happily navigating the world of frontend development in the newcomer village.

The host will share their firsthand experiences of transitioning careers from the perspectives of both an industry veteran and a newcomer.

This series will be divided into **four episodes**. In the fourth episode, we will delve into the map and compass in the toolkit: the _learning roadmap_ and the _consistent learning methods_.
