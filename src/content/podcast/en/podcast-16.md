## Show Introduction

There are numerous recommendations for English learning apps on the internet. With the addition of AI, the app market has become even more viral (or perhaps filled with hype). Are these tools really useful? Can they truly aid in learning English? With this question in mind, we evaluated several English learning tools that are fairly good in terms of aesthetics, functionality, and ease of use. They are: Language Reactor, Qwerty Learner, Snipd, and ChatGPT.

Will using these auxiliary tools ultimately fall into the trap of "poor students having too many stationery items" or will it truly fulfill the saying "to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools"? Have AI tools really revolutionized the entire way we learn English? After our evaluation, we have reached our conclusions, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts in the comments section.
