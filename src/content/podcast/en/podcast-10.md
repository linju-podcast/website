## Introduction

Have you ever encountered words in English that don't quite look like "normal" English, or phrases whose pronunciation seems to defy "rules"? In this episode, we delve into these "strange" phenomena with numerous real-life examples. And, since the female host is a big fan of Harry Potter, we'll start our discussion from there.

## Hosts
