## Introduction

For those transitioning or just starting to learn programming, one common challenge is encountering terms that seem familiar but whose meanings remain elusive, or sifting through abundant online resources without knowing which ones are best suited.

In the "Programming Concepts Everyone Can Understand" series, we aim to demystify programming concepts by explaining each one in three stages: "Novice", "Beginner", and "Continuous Improvement", hoping to provide some enlightenment on your journey of learning to code.

In this episode, we'll delve into the concepts of client and server.
