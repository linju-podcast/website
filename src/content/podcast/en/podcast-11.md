## Introduction

For career changers or those just starting out in programming, a common difficulty on the learning path is encountering terms that seem familiar but are hard to grasp in context, or navigating the vast array of resources available online without knowing which information is most relevant.

In the "Programming Concepts Everyone Can Understand" series, we aim to demystify programming concepts by breaking them down into three stages: "Non-programmers," "Beginner programmers," and "Endless improvement." We hope to provide some insight to your journey in learning programming.

In this episode, we'll discuss HTTP.
