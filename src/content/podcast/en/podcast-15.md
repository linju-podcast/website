## Show Introduction

Among the peripherals commonly used by programmers, mechanical keyboards are definitely a topic that cannot be ignored.

Some people pursue a tactile experience different from that of a laptop keyboard, like host Papaya; others are very interested in this peripheral, like host S1ngS1ng, who has participated in many mechanical keyboard exhibitions in North America.

In this episode, we will explore the history and current state of mechanical keyboards from S1ngS1ng's perspective. We will share some basic information about mechanical keyboards, including key layouts, switches, keycaps, product recommendations, and more.

Whether you are considering getting into mechanical keyboards or are already an enthusiast, we believe you will resonate with us.
