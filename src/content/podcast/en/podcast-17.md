## Show Introduction

If you're already into mechanical keyboards, you've probably heard of "customization". "Customization" greatly enhances the playability of mechanical keyboards. From the layout and firmware to the keycaps, switches, and PCBs, every part and related software of a mechanical keyboard can be "customized". You can create a keyboard that's uniquely yours based on your preferences.

In this episode, we'll listen to S1ngS1ng's insights and reflections on his years of diving into the world of "customization". Which aspects are particularly addictive, which ones are especially beginner-friendly, and which "urban legends" might just be myths.

Of course, we also look forward to you sharing your "customization" experiences in the comments section.
