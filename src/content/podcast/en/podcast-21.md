## Episode Introduction

I've always found English names to be a fascinating topic. After all, we usually only have one Chinese name, but English names can be more flexible; our Chinese names are often given by parents or elders, but English names are typically chosen by ourselves.
The process of choosing an English name can feel quite mystical. For instance, you might pick a name simply because it sounds good, or because you like its meaning, or to express your personality. However, English names themselves have many aspects worth exploring.

In this episode, we attempt to discuss English names from the perspectives of etymology, phonology, and sociolinguistics. Of course, we haven't forgotten the "Is it necessary?" part. We also discuss whether it's necessary to have an English name when living abroad and look forward to hearing your views and opinions.
