## Episode Introduction

There’s a fascinating category of memes on the internet related to Chinese-English translation, such as the Chinese phrases tattooed on foreigners' skin, and bilingual menus. While these memes are amusing, we also want to explore why such "translation memes" come into existence.

In this episode, we discuss the reasons behind these "translation memes" from three perspectives: differences in Chinese and English word order, cultural differences between the East and West, and the historical context of translations. We hope this sparks further discussion and invite you to share your experiences and insights in the comments.
